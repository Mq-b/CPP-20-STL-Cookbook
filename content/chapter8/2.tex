Introduced with C++17, the std::optional class holds an optional value.

Consider the case where you have a function that may or may not return a value – for example, a function that checks if a number is prime but returns the first factor if there is one. This function should return either a value or a bool status. We could create a struct that carries both value and status:


\subsubsection{How to do it…}


\subsubsection{How it works…}

\subsubsection{There's more…}
