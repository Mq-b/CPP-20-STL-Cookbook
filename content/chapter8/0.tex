The C++ Standard Library includes an assortment of utility classes designed for specific tasks. Some are common, and you've probably seen many of these classes in other recipes in this book.

This chapter covers a broad range of utilities, including time measurement, generic types, smart pointers, and more, in the following recipes:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Manage optional values with std::optional

\item 
Use std::any for type safety

\item 
Store different types with std::variant

\item 
Time events with std::chrono

\item 
Use fold expressions for variadic tuples

\item 
Manage allocated memory with std::unique\_ptr

\item 
Share objects with std::shared\_ptr

\item 
Use weak pointers with shared objects

\item 
Share members of a managed object

\item 
Compare random number engines

\item 
Compare random number distribution generators
\end{itemize}
