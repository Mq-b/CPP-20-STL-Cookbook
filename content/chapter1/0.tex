This chapter concentrates on some of the more compelling features that C++20 adds to the STL. You can use some of these right away. Others may need to wait for implementation in your favorite compiler. But in the long run, I expect you'll want to know about most of these features.

There are a lot of new additions to the C++20 standard, far more than we could cover here. These are a few that I think will have long-term impact.

我们将讨论以下主题:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Format text with the new format library

\item 
Use compile-time vectors and strings with constexpr

\item 
Safely compare integers of different types

\item 
Use the "spaceship" operator <=> for three-way comparisons

\item 
Easily find feature test macros with the <version> header

\item 
Create safer templates with concepts and constraints

\item 
Avoid re-compiling template libraries with modules

\item 
Create views into containers with ranges
\end{itemize}

This chapter aims to familiarize you with these new features in C++20, so you may use them in your own projects and understand them when you encounter them.
