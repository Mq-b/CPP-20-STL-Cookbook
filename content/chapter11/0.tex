We've learned some useful techniques in this book, including optional values, containers, iterators, algorithms, smart pointers, and more. We've seen examples of these concepts in use, and we've had the opportunity to experiment and apply them to some small projects. Let's now apply these techniques to a few more practical ideas.

In this chapter, we cover the following recipes:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Create a trie class for search suggestions

\item 
Calculate the error sum of two vectors

\item 
Build your own algorithm: split

\item 
Leverage existing algorithms: gather

\item 
Remove consecutive whitespace

\item 
Convert numbers to words
\end{itemize}
