This chapter is a general potpourri of STL features and techniques. These are mostly new features introduced over the past few years, which may not yet be widely used. These are useful techniques that will improve the simplicity and readability of your code.

我们将讨论以下主题:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Use the new span class to make your C-arrays safer

\item 
Use structured binding to return multiple values

\item 
Initialize variables within if and switch statements

\item 
Use template argument deduction for simplicity and clarity

\item 
Use if constexpr to simplify compile-time decisions
\end{itemize}
