Iterators are a fundamental concept in the STL. Iterators are implemented with the semantics of C pointers, using the same increment, decrement, and dereference operators. The pointer idiom is familiar to most C/C++ programmers, and it allows algorithms such as std::sort and std::transform to work on primitive memory buffers as well as STL containers.
